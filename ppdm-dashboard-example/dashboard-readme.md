# The Art of the possible with PPDM Automation
If you are looking to build your custom portal or dashboard, PPDM offers a robust API that you can leverage to create dashboards for measuring your application backup SLA, governance, and compliance. For instance, you can track the status of backups for your clients. Out of 950 clients, 945 have been successfully backed up, while 5 of them have breached the defined SLA.

Here is an example dashboard that i built for demonstration purpose. This is built using Python flask.
